        <h2>My Projects from this year.</h2>
        <p>
          During my senior year I had the opportunity to take a class called Web Design. learning  Basic HTML was first adn then we built up from there. Learning CSS design while making a business card from either yourself or a made up brand. I was able to learn so much from this class and so down below you will be able to find links to some of my favorite projects that I have done in that year.
